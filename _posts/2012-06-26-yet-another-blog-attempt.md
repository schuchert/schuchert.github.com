I've worked with several blogging sites and I keep falling back to using [my wiki site](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/). I'm starting with a few small posts to get my feet wet. If I like the overall experience and the code formatting options, then I'll move on to writing bigger blogs. I hope that I'll be able to develop a template or tool that can take this same format and produce various e-book formats.
